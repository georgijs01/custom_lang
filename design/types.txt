built-in types:

integer:
- standard integer implementation, 64-bit width?
floating point number
- double precision floating point numbers
boolean
string
vector
- variable-length collection
- declared as [v1, v2, ... vn]
hashmap
- declared as {k1: v1, k2: v2, ..., kn: vn}
tuple
- declared as (v1, v2, v3)
-? possibly too similar to vector, as lang is dynamically typed anyway
